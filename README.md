# 📚 CSlight Library

## 📌 Project Description

**CSlight Library** is a simple C# console application that simulates a mini library system. The program allows users to browse a list of authors, find an author by index (shelf and position), and search for an author by name using a text-based menu.

This project is designed as a **learning project** for practicing basic C# concepts and console application development.
